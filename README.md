The uploaded Java files implement CRUD functionality for managing student records:

CrudApp.java: A comprehensive app providing options to add, view, update, or delete student records via a menu-driven interface.
DeleteStudent.java: Focuses solely on deleting a student by roll number.
FetchByRollNo.java: Retrieves and displays a student's details using their roll number.
All programs rely on database connections and use the StudentDao interface for operations.
